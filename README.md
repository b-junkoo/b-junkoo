### Hi there, I'm Jun Koo! ðŸ‘‹
A little bit about me: I did my undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology where I received my degree in Chemical Engineering.  
During my senior design project, I noticed that I was much more interested in the coding aspects of the project than the chemical engineering side.  
Now I'm trying to independently learn Python and other languages to switch career paths and ultimately land an data scientist/engineering job.
