### Index of Personal Projects  
I am doing these projects to gain working proficiency in Python. 
1. [Sudoku](https://github.com/b-junkoo/Sudoku) - Uses a backtracking algorithm to create a fully solvable Sudoku board which is then mapped to a fully interactable GUI. Comes with a solver button that preserves your inputs if they were correct and a new button that creates an entirely new puzzle.
2. [Online Weather Scraper with GUI](https://github.com/b-junkoo/WeatherGUI) - Retrieves week's weather forecast from Weather.gov's website and displays it using a GUI

### Kaggle Competitions:
The Basics:  
1. [Titanic: Machine Learning From Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/bumjunkoo/titanic-top-20-with-support-vector-machines) - Classification Project: Create a model that predicts whether a passenger of the Titanic survived or not.
2. [Housing Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/bumjunkoo/house-prices) - Regression Project: Create a model that predicts housing prices in Ames, Iowa.
### Hi there, I'm Jun Koo! ðŸ‘‹
A little bit about me: I did my undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology where I received my degree in Chemical Engineering.  
During my senior design project, I noticed that I was much more interested in the coding aspects of the project than the chemical engineering side.  
Now I'm trying to independently learn Python and other languages to switch career paths and ultimately land a data scientist/engineering job.
